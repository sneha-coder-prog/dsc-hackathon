This notebook was created as part of DataQuest 2.0, a hackathon organized by the Data Science Club, VIT Chennai. The challenge involved analyzing a custom image dataset with 13 location-based classes and preparing it for model training in future stages.

**Objective**
Perform exploratory data analysis on the training dataset to:

Understand dataset structure and image distribution.

Visualize class balance and image samples.

Plan preprocessing and augmentation strategies.

**Key Analyses Performed**
Dataset Overview: Counted total training images, checked for missing values.

Class Distribution: Visualized class-wise image counts using Seaborn bar plots.

Image Properties: Displayed random image samples and their shapes.

Preprocessing Plan:

Normalize image pixel values

Resize all images to a common shape (e.g., 224x224)

Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

Seaborn

Matplotlib

OpenCV (cv2)

Google Colab
